This database offers precise measurements of atmospheric methane and 
13C/12C in atmospheric methane from flask air samples collected at eight 
sites worldwide and aboard NOAA cruises in the Pacific Ocean. The eight 
sites include Olympic Peninsula, Washington; Cape Grim, Tasmania; 
Fraserdale, Ontario; Marshall Islands; Baring Head, New Zealand; 
Mauna Loa, Hawaii; Point Barrow, Alaska; and American Samoa. The 
measurements span the period 1988 to mid-1996. These data are
useful for global methane budget analyses and for determining the 
atmospheric isotopic composition of methane. All isotopic measurements 
have been corrected for standard drift.
